A project to understand how ML models are built, using data from [here][datalink]. The code is largely adapted from the Julia [Flux Model Zoo][codelink]. The simpler Neural net offers low accuracy (using the provided default params) while the LeNET5 (convolutional) model offers a substantial improvement.
